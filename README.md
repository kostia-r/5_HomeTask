Homework # 5: 

A library for controlling the PCA9685 PWM controller through the I2C bus has been implemented.

Functional:
-on / off all channels with indication of the total duty cycle and delay
-individual setting of each channel (duty cycle, delay)
-changing the PWM frequency
-sleep mode.
The PWM controller is controlled via the UART interface from the computer terminal (except for the adjustment of individual channels, it is not included in the scope of the task).

UART3 settings: baud rate 115200, 8bit, no parity, 1 stop bit.
